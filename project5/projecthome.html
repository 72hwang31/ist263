            This site will showcase a number of giants from different mythologies and folklore. You will learn about their stories, get to know how big they are, and witness the imagination and creativity of ancient people. Some would be very familiar and you may even know more about them than what the website provides. But some would be more niche, and you will learn something useless but fun facts to talk about with your friends. However, will it be enough? Are the frightful imaginations of ancient times still impactful to readers of the modern age, who see gigantic skyscrapers as a common occurrence? Join us on a journey of discovery over at the page of contents.
