        <p>The twin giants Ephialtes and Otos, were the sons of Iphimedeia, who was the wife of Aloeus, thus their epithet Aloadai. However, their real father was Poseidon, the god of the sea. From a young age, they were excellent hunters. At age nine, they grew to a terrible size and were known as the tallest and handsomest of men aside from Orion. They were so confident in their own strength that they decided to challenge the gods themselves. According to Pseudo-Apollodorus, “So they set Mount Ossa on top of Mount Olympos, and then placed Mount Pelion on top of Ossa, threatening by means of these mountains to climb up to the sky; and they also said that they would dam up the sea with mountains and make it dry, and make the dry land a sea.” When Ares, the god of war, tried to stop them; Ephialtes and Otos tied Ares up with chains and stuck him in a cauldron until Hermes rescued him. However, their downfall came once their hubris overcame their bonds with each other. When a stag came between the twins, sent either by Apollo or Artemis, the twins each decided to hunt the stag by themselves. They each threw a javelin at the stag, which missed the stag and hit each other instead, killing them instantly.</p>

        <div>It is said that the Aloadai twins grew to be nine cubits in width and nine fathoms in height. A cubit is 1.5 feet and a fathom is 4 cubits. This would mean that they were 13.5 feet/4.1 meters wide and 54 feet/16.5 meters tall. Both of them would be wider than an elephant's height and taller than the famous Hollywood sign in LA. What's more impressive is that this was only their size at age nine. They would have grown even larger if they had lived longer.</div>
