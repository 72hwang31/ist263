        <p>There is a race of giants 大人 from the kingdom of Longbo 龙伯国. It is said they have a lifespan of 18,000 years. One day, one of these giants went on a fishing trip in the ocean. The giant fished up six Ao 鳌, giant turtles, and returned home. Whereupon he burned these turtles to use their bones for divination. However, these six turtles were part of the fifteen holding up the five mystic mountains, Daiyu 岱舆, Yuanjiao 员峤, Fanghu 方壶, Yingzhou 瀛洲, and Penglai 蓬莱. They were put there by Yujiang 禺疆, the god of the northern sea, under the orders of the Heavenly Emperor 天帝. Without these six turtles, two of the mountains, Daiyu and Yuanjiao, drifted off into the north and sank into the sea. Causing more than a hundred thousand immortals who lived near these mountains to be affected. Furious, the Heavenly Emperor inflicted the people of Longbo with a disease and shrunk their size.</p>

        <div>It is said that before they were shrunk, the giants of Longbo Kingdom could walk through the ocean and get to the five mountains in a couple of steps. This is no small feat as the mountains were near a place of void called Guixu 归墟 which was hundreds of thousands of li 里 (one li during the Han Dynasty=0.4 km) from the mainland. The mountains were also said to be 70,000 li apart from each other. Consider the implications of the size of the turtles holding up these mountains. Yet six of these turtles were easily fished up by one giant. After the giants were shrunk, it is said that during the reigns of Fuxi and Shennong, the people were still tens of zhang 丈 tall. Another account mentions them to be approximately 30 zhang. By the standards at the time these stories were written, a zhang would be around 2.3 meters, placing the shrunken height of these giants still reaching up to 226 feet/69 meters. This would make the shrunken giants taller than the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty and reach the statue's waist.</div>
