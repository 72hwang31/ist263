        <p>Alcyoneus was the eldest of the Gigantes, giants born from Gaia and the blood of Uranus. Aside from his size and strength, he is also immortal as long as he remains in his homeland Pallene. His story differs in each account. In one story he fights with his brothers against the Olympians in a huge battle. In another story, he was simply an antagonistic herdsman to the hero Herakles, where he “with rocks his only weapon, felled twelve four-horse chariots, and the men who bestrode them twice the number, proud horsemen all” (footnote here). In any case, he was defeated by Herakles who shot him with an arrow, though his power kept him alive. Herakles then, with the advice of Athena, dragged Alcyoneus out of Pallene where he died from his wounds.

        <div>Alcyoneus was said to be “nine cubits high”. A cubit would be about 1 and ½ feet. So the giant would be 13.5 feet/4.1 meters tall. That is taller than the largest recorded elephant. An impressive size but not much compared to some modern city buildings.</div>
