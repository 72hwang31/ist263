        <p>Fangfengshi 防风氏 was a minor mountain god who was the leader of a clan of giants called the Wangmangshi 汪芒氏 in ancient China. During the mythological time of great floods, the god-king Yu 禹 summons the various mountain gods to meet at Kuaiji 会稽 to discuss his plans to control the floods. However, Fangfengshi was late to the meeting due to his own troubles with the floods, and was executed by Yu. Later, when Yu is patrolling through the south on a chariot drawn by two dragons, some of Fangfengshi's subjects shot at Yu for revenge, but merely startled the dragons. Fangfengshi's subjects then killed themselves out of fear by stabbing their own chests. Out of pity for their loyalty, Yu revived them by putting plants of immortality in the holes in their chest. Their descendants became the People of Through-Chest 穿胸民. The giant bones of Fangfengshi were supposedly uncovered thousands of years later during the time of Confucius 孔子 in the kingdom of Wu 吴 which required various chariots to carry. He would be worshiped throughout southern China, with wooden and earth statues showing his appearance with a dragon's head, ox's ears, a single brow, and one eyed.</p>

        <div>Fangfengshi 防风氏 was stated to be three “zhang丈” tall. A “zhang” in the period that the earliest sources were believed to be written in was around 2.3 meters. It would mean that Fangfengshi is around 6.9 meters/22 feet and 8 inches tall. That is just a little shorter than an average 3-story apartment building. Another account states that his height was five "zhang" and four "chi". Ten "chi" equals to 1 "zhang". So his height would be around 12.42 meters/40 feet and 9 inches tall. Impressive but not humongous like Godzilla in the movies. </div>
