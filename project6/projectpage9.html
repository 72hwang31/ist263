        <p>Before the world came to be, there was chaos in the form of an egg. Within the egg, grew a being known as Pangu 盘古. After 18,000 years, the egg broke, and heaven and earth began to separate, being held up by Pangu. Within each day, heaven and earth each grew one zhang 丈 thicker and Pangu grew one zhang taller. After another 18,000 years, heaven and earth have separated completely. With his purpose complete, Pangu's breath became the clouds and winds, his sound became thunder, his eyes became the sun and moon, his limbs became the mountains, his blood the rivers, his muscles the earth, his hair the stars, his skin the grass, his teeth and bones became metals and stones, his sweat the rain, and the insects within his body became life.</p>

        <div>As mentioned in the myth, Pangu grew one zhang 丈 every day. Since he passed 18,000 years within the cosmic egg and another 18,000 years splitting heaven and earth. Pangu would have grown to be 13,140,000 zhang 丈, or 73,000 li 里, or about 18,460 miles/30,000 kilometers. That is three times higher than the top of the atmosphere of Earth. Befitting of a creation god from mythology, but now we know that the universe is still much bigger than that.</div>
